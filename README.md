<b>PeerPong is a peer 2 peer pong game developped using <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs" alt="Peerjs">Peerjs</a></b>

I had randomly sumbled upon Peerjs while looking for ideas for javascript projects and was impressed by it's power and simplicity so I tried to come up with a fun implementation for it so PeerPong was born!

### Gameplay instructions
So you wanna play the game huh, well you're in the right place, since it's a simple pong game at it's core to play simply use:
<ul>
<li>USE W/S or Arrow Up/Down keys to move the paddle</li>
</ul>

In order to play against another player ask them for their id and imput it in the userId box on the ui and click "Challenge User", challenging someone makes you the "host" and your paddle will be on the left side while the enemy paddle will be on the right side.
If you want to send a text message to the _enemy_ simply input your message in the input box and click "Send Message"

And that about covers it now, head over to https://peerpong.netlify.app/ to start playing.
